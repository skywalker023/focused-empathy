* **TL;DR**:
In order to express deeper empathy in dialogues, we argue that responses should focus on the cause of emotions.
Inspired by _perspective-taking_ of humans, we propose a **generative emotion estimator (GEE)** which can recognize emotion cause words solely based on sentence-level emotion labels without word-level annotations (_i.e.,_ weak-supervision).
To evaluate our approach, we annotate emotion cause words and release the **EmoCause** evaluation set.
We also propose a _pragmatics-based_ method for generating responses focused on targeted words from the context.

```

## Implementation

### System Requirements

* Python 3.7.9
* Pytorch 1.6.0
* CUDA 10.2 supported GPU with at least 24GB memory
* See [environment.yml](https://github.com/skywalker023/focused-empathy/blob/master/environment.yml) for details

### Environment setup

Our code is built on the [ParlAI](https://parl.ai/) framework. We recommend you create a conda environment as follows

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

and activate it with

```bash
conda activate focused-empathy
python -m spacey download en
```

## EmoCause evaluation set for weakly-supervised emotion cause recognition
**EmoCause** is a dataset of annotated emotion cause words in emotional situations from the [EmpatheticDialogues](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1534.pdf) valid and test set.
The goal is to recognize emotion cause words in sentences by training only on sentence-level emotion labels without word-level labels (*i.e., weakly-supervised emotion cause recognition*).
**EmoCause** is based on the fact that humans do not recognize the cause of emotions with supervised learning on word-level cause labels.
Thus, we do not provide a training set.

You can download the **EmoCause** eval set [[here]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LR4B47Fna_l63G1X4DZtuttG-GrinnaY/view?usp=sharing).<br>
Note, the dataset will be downloaded automatically when you run the experiment command below.


### Data statistics and structure

|          | #Emotion | Label type | #Label/Utterance | #Utterance |
|----------|:--------:|:----------:|:----------------:|:----------:|
| **EmoCause** |    32    |    Word    |        2.3       |    4.6K    |

```
{
  "original_situation": the original situations in the EmpatheticDialogues,
  "tokenized_situation": tokenized situation utterances using spacy,
  "emotion": emotion labels,
  "conv_id": id for each corresponding conversation in EmpatheticDialogues,
  "annotation": list of tuples: (emotion cause word, index),
  "labels": list of strings containing the emotion cause words
}
```

## Running Experiments

All corresponding models will be downloaded automatically when running the following commands.<br>
We also provide manual download links: [[GEE]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TEKp3YRowAZju4UPXOSufqzU6j6_Z4wy/view?usp=sharing) [[Finetuned Blender]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WwSy0D1KzhhOOpXmBRQMJzp0aJ2K0bDv/view?usp=sharing)

### Weakly-supervised emotion cause word recognition with GEE on EmoCause

You can evaluate our proposed Generative Emotion Estimator (GEE) on the EmoCause eval set.

```bash
python eval_emocause.py --model agents.gee_agent:GeeCauseInferenceAgent --fp16 False
```

### Focused empathetic response generation with finetuned Blender on EmpatheticDialogues

You can evaluate our approach for generating focused empathetic responses on top of a finetuned Blender (Not familiar with Blender? See [here](https://parl.ai/projects/recipes/)!).

```bash
python eval_empatheticdialogues.py --model agents.empathetic_gee_blender:EmpatheticBlenderAgent --model_file data/models/finetuned_blender90m/model --fp16 False --empathy-score False
```

Adding the `--alpha 0` flag will run the Blender without pragmatics. You can also try the random distractor (Plain S1) by adding `--distractor-type random`.

ðŸ’¡ To measure the Interpretation and Exploration scores also, set the `--empathy-score` to `True`. It will automatically download the RoBERTa models finetuned on EmpatheticDialogues.
